  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <div id='main'>
  <p>Coding is just building a computer programme that does something to either carry out a specific task or solve a problem. And these programmes are made out of smaller things, each of which carry out a more specific operation, to help with the whole task. These are known as algorithms. Algorithms are just a simple operating process that carries out a specific function. This is where we start.</p>
    </br>
  <p>There are many programming languages out there, such as Python; R; Go; Java; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (those there we used for this webpage!); SQL, a data dealing language; and of course the C languages, C, C++, and C#. There are many more but here I listed a few. Throughout this website, to explain I will be using something known as <em>pseudocode</em>, which is an implentation in a code-like format english. This means there is no rigorous and strict syntax, and so is easy to understand. LET'S START...

  <h2>Data Types</h2>
  <div id='main'>
    <p>See below a table of data types and what they are. Click on them to see more information.</p>

    <table style='margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;'>
      <tr>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th>What is it?</th>

      <tr>
        <td>Char</td>
        <td>A single letter</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>A collection of multiple chars, or more accurately, text</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Integer</td>
        <td>A whole number</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Double</td>
        <td>A decimal number</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Float</td>
        <td>A decimal number with a floating point</td>

<!--A project of my own, creating a website for people who know not much about coding, and teaching the fundamentals (data types, logic (e.g. boolean), looping etc.)-->
<!--Keep in mind this is a work in progress-->
<!--Offer suggestions-->
  
 <!--To add_booleans,lists,arrays,date,time. Also table formatting (and JS for alert())-->
