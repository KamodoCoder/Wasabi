Model code structures for many languages. Create branches, and merging can create...new things...
Ok let's see here...

We have three documents in this repository:


# Python
--> The python file. This is a language with not much, if you can call it, useless syntax. So all I have done is imported some modules already for you to create
    branches. This is a good source to learn python: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp 
    Since this is a simple language with little syntax, if you don't know much coding, I think this is a good place to start.
    
# HTML, JS, CSS

--> The HTML file. This stands for hypertext markup language, and unlike python isn't a programming language of such. The reason I say this is because a programme
    uses algorithms, or makes things do things to solve things, in simpler terms. HTML is all about display and so cannot really be called a programming language,
    however all of these can be called coding languages, as it uses text in a file format do do something (no necessarily input driven however).
    This is a good source to learn HTML: https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
    
--> However, in that document there is more than just HTML, there is JavaScript (abbreviated JS), and CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. JS is
    a programming language, and is used inbetween the script tags of an HTML document (but can be in a different JS file, or JSON for APIs, or Application
    Programming Interfaces, more about them at the end of this point). I recommend here to learn JS: https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
    
--> And finally we come to CSS, the show, or *style* of the document, hence being used between the style tags. It is all about formatting text and images and
    videos to make them look nice. Here is a good learning resource for it: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp
    
    
--> HTML is used mostly in web pages, and are very useful for doing so. The HTML is the display, the CSS is the style, and JS is the brainworks behind it. It is 
    also the language used for APIs, or Application Programme Interfaces, which are essentially used to communicate with the webpage to help it do its job, and
    actually take data from it / send data to it. Here is a very good video on APIs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us
    
    
# C sharp

--> C# is by far the hardest of these languages, but not harder than C or C++, those are really hard. Resources to them here:
                                                                                                       https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/
                                                                                                       https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp
    
--> C# us a language used a lot for applications, and so is very useful to know. First came C, a coding language with very challenging but rewarding syntax,
    then came C++, a continuation of C in a different way. But then came Microsoft, which to C and made it into the easier C#. C# is very similar to JS or Java
    today, however actually descended form C++, so if you want to learn JS or Java, knowing some C# could make it easier. C# is a programming language which
    uses namespaces to create and application of some sort. Namespaces are a collection of classes. And classes are a collection of functions, or methods, which
    are the things that do things. There are also different properties that can be set in each class, but since it is a programme, there is something which needs
    to be done. This is done by the Main function, however there can be as many functions are you wish, as long as the main is there. Syntax for the document can
    be found in that file. This is a good learning source for C#: https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php
    
    
    
# Last Words

I hope this is useful for those who know not so much about these languages, and which to make branches on these documents, to help with their learning. Of course,
there is more than just templates, there will be projects we can work on together, as a collective, and feel free to leave any comments on this to give me ideas,
and if you know me, contact me!

Here is the website I recommend using for coding, and learning whatever language you may want. There is a wide variety, and is very beginner friendly:
                                                                                                                          https://www.w3schools.com/

# Wait I forgot... RULES

Just a few rules to make this collaboration enviroment friendly and relevant:

--> Keep everything family friendly and safe i.e. no swearing, explicit content etc.

--> Don't comment/message things which are completely irrelevant (so are very personal to you, or are just not coding/repo related), but do feel free to ask
    people how they are. This is not particularly binding, so don't worry too much about this, but keep it in mind.
    
--> Do not spam pull/merge requests, otherwise they will *definitiely* not be accepted (reposting if a lot of feed has happened is fine).

--> Be friendly and non-toxic


Please obey this rules, or you may be banned, but don't feel constrained.
